# Rebase Witness API

The witness API provides the generation of statements for cryptographically verifiable claims and the witnessing of these claims to produce [Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/). 

A concrete implementation of this API exists in the Cloudflare Worker found [here](https://github.com/spruceid/rebase/tree/main/demo/witness). It could also be implemented as a more traditional web server, or as a serverless function.

The witness exposes three routes, `/instructions`, `/statement` and `/witness`, which are described in detail in the following sections. They exist in the expected context of a UI describing the steps of the flow after retrieving them from the `/instructions` route, delivering user information (including a cryptographic public key) from a user to the witness via `/statement` to create a statement, then the user signing the statement with public key described in the statement. After the statement is signed, and in some cases published, the user then gives the witness enough information to validate that the signature and statement match the statement's attestation through the `/witness` route. 

Assuming everything is valid, the witness issues a Verifiable Credential in the form of a [JWT](https://jwt.io/introduction).

## Issuance Flow

0) The UI retrieves the instructions and schemas for expected request bodies from the `/instructions` route.

1) The user supplies information relevant to create a statement. It will always include at least one public key and either an identifier to link to that key, or a second key to link with the first.

2) The information from step 1 is passed to the worker in the body of a `POST` request to the route `/statement`, the UI tests that the `POST` request body conforms to the schema recieved in step 0.

3) The information is parsed, and if it matches the form specified below, is used to generate a plain text statement and optionally a delimiter (sometimes ommitted) which are returned in the response body as `statement` and `delimiter` respectively.

4) The user signs the statement at least once. For linking two public keys, the statement is signed twice and signatures returned to the witness in the format as described below. 

    In the case of other identity linking flows that involve delimiters, a post is created in the format of: `${statement}${delimiter}${signature}`, then posted somewhere only the identity in the statement could access. 

    In other flows, the user is only expected to post the `signature`. Alternatively, in some flows, like email, the witness generates a challenge, sends it to the targeted account, and the user has to present the challenge along side the signature to prove ownership.

    Once sufficent proof is gathered it is `POST`ed, along with the options used to generate the statement initially are supplied to `/witness`. The UI makes sure this `POST` body conforms to the schema given in step 0.

5) The witness parses the `POST` request and assuming it conforms to the format described below either validates the proof, compares the owner of the proof to the owner described in the statement and verifies that public key described in the statement was the one that signed the statement. 

6) Presuming all of that is valid the witness returns a Verifiable Credential to the end user.

## Statement and Witness Requests

All responses that are not errors are consistent in their format as JSON objects. 

The `instructions` response rendered as a TypeScript type is:
```typescript
// type JSONSchema = <a_valid_JSON_schema_object>;
interface InstructionsRes {
    "statement": string,
    "signature": string,
    "witness": string,
    "statement_schema": JSONSchema,
    "witness_schema": JSONSchema
}
```

The `statement` response rendered as a TypeScript type is always:
```typescript
interface StatementRes {
    "statement": string,
    "delimiter"?: string
}
```

The `witness` response rendered as a TypeScript type is always:
```typescript
interface WitnessRes {
    "jwt": string,
}
```

(NOTE: The Rebase Witness SDK also supports LD-proof format, even though this demo ommits it).

The `POST` body of `/statement` (and all routes supported by the Witness) are described in the [Rebase Witness SDK](https://github.com/spruceid/rebase/tree/main/rust/rebase_witness_sdk), in the `src/types.rs` file, defined as `StatementReq`.

The TypeScript definition of a Statement body would look like:
```typescript
interface Statement {
    opts: Statements;
}
```

With `Statements` being a sum type:
```typescript
type Statements =
    | DnsStmt
    | EmailStmt
    | GitHubStmt
    | RedditStmt
    | SameStmt
    | SoundCloudStmt
    | TwitterStmt;
```

And the individual statements being:
```typescript
interface DnsStmt {
    dns: {
        domain: string;
        prefix: string;
        subject: Subject;
    };
}

interface EmailStmt {
    email: {
        email: string;
        subject: Subject;
    }
}

interface GitHubStmt {
    github: {
        handle: string;
        subject: Subject;
    };
}

interface RedditStmt {
    reddit: {
        handle: string;
        subject: Subject;
    };
}

interface SameStmt {
    same: {
        id1: Subject;
        id2: Subject;
    };
}

interface SoundCloud {
    soundcloud: {
        permalink: string;
        subject: Subject;
    };
}

interface TwitterStmt {
    twitter: {
        handle: string;
        subject: Subject;
    };
}
```

`Subject`s must conform to the JSON representation of the supported Rebase Subject type found [here](https://github.com/spruceid/rebase/blob/main/rust/rebase/src/types/enums/subject.rs).
They TypeScript definition of Subjects and it's child types would look like:
```typescript
type Subjects = Eth | Solana | Web;

interface Eth {
    pkh: {
        eip155: {
            address: string;
            chain_id: "1";
        };
    };
}

interface Solana {
    pkh: {
        solana: {
            address: string;
        };
    };
}

interface Web {
    web: string;
}
```

A sample GitHub request would look like: 
```json
{
    "opts": {
        "github": {
            "handle": "foo",
            "subject": {
                "pkh": {
                    "eip155": {
                        "address": "0x1111111111111111111111111111111111111111",
                        "chain_id": "1"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The response would look like:
```json
{
    "statement": "I am attesting that this GitHub handle foo is linked to the Ethereum Address 0x1111111111111111111111111111111111111111",
    "delimiter": "\n\n"
}
```

## Witness Flow

The `POST` body of `/witness` must conform to a JSON representation of the supported Rebase `proof_type`, the source of which in Rust can be found [here](https://github.com/spruceid/rebase/blob/main/rust/rebase_witness_sdk/src/types.rs), which also includes type definitions for the requests and responses outlined in this document.

The TypeScript definition of a Witness body would look like:
```typescript
interface Proof {
    proof: ProofTypes;
}
```
With `ProofTypes` being a sum type:
```typescript
type ProofTypes =
        | DnsStmt
        | EmailProof
        | GitHubProof
        | RedditStmt
        | SameProof
        | SoundCloudStmt
        | TwitterProof;
```
(NOTE: `DnsStmt`, `RedditStmt`, and `SoundCloudStmt` are used for both the statement route and the witness route)

The proofs that contain new information look like:
```typescript
interface EmailProof {
    email: {
        auth: string;
        signature: string;
        statement: GitHubStmt;
        timestamp: string;
    };
}

interface GitHubProof {
    github: {
        gist_id: string;
        statement: GitHubStmt;
    };
}

interface SameProof {
    same: {
        signature1: string;
        signature2: string;
        statement: SameStmt;
    };
}

interface TwitterProof {
    twitter: {
        statement: TwitterStmt;
        tweet_url: string;
    };
}
```

An example (VALID) request for a GitHub proof would look like:
```json
{
    "proof": {
        "github":{
            "statement_opts":{
                "handle":"krhoda",
                "subject": {
                    "pkh": {
                        "eip155": {
                            "address":"0xdA3176d77c04632F2862B14E35bc6B4717FB5016","chain_id":"1"
                        }
                    }
                }
            },
            "gist_id":"3836dc1154d9499c55106c84b9c4bc1c"
        }
    }
}
```
The (VALID) result of such a request would look like:
```json
{
    "jwt": "eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsImtpZCI6ImRpZDp3ZWI6cmViYXNlZGVtb2tleS5wYWdlcy5kZXYjY29udHJvbGxlciJ9.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.ODuLC1uuJTaQ_buxyOtklw-XDEfGwBeaR14scLz4FvqTCQzbg2w4mtNgozVCoHJpAIqmgzRPMFynJMmOaM-9CA"

```

Once decoded, the JWT shows as:
The header:
```json
{
  "alg": "EdDSA",
  "kid": "did:web:rebasedemokey.pages.dev#controller"
}
```
The body:
